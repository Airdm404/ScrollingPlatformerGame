# Example Team Contract

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * respect each other's ideas and work.
 * communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.

 ### Team meetings:
 * Five scheduled meetings per week, at the following times:
 * Wednesday: 8:30 pm
 * Thursday: 10 pm
 * Saturday: 4 pm 
 * Sunday: 4 pm
 * Monday: 8:30 pm 
 * Every effort should be made to attend these meetings. If you cannot attend, let the group know ASAP, and text what you have accomplished. We
 will work out over Slack/text what you should do before the next meeting.
 
 * At the beginning of the meeting, everyone says what they did (and, if they didn't finish anything, what they were supposed to do but didn't)
 * Everyone makes an agreement on what specific things they will do before the next meeting.
 * If you are going to miss a meeting, text ASAP, and communicate what you got done over text.
 * To handle disagreements, have a discussion, and vote if it gets contentious. If a 2/2 tie, keep discussing until we can break the tie.
 
 ### Communications:
 * Preferred channel of communications: Slack and zoom meetings. Can also use text groupchat
 * Respond to messages within 24 hours
 * Message in the slack group whenever you make a major decision / change / update
 
 ### Helping each other:
 * Each team member will ask for help when needed
 * Each team member will "go above and beyond" as needed to support the team and even other teams
 
 ### Commitments:
 * Each team member will do work to the best of his/her ability and on time and provide commitments others on the team can rely on
 * If someone fails to meet a commitment: talk about it with the group in next team meeting. 
 * If, after a team discussion and at least 2 tries to get the person to do their commitments, they are still not resolved - 
 can reach out to course staff.
