# Management Plan

## Week 1: Test
### Goals:
- Be able to load a level of a platform game.
- Move player around using arrow keys and jump with spacebar
- Have Entity collision (i.e. Player doesn't fall thru floor)
- Developing a win/lose condition reaching a point in the level
- Use clear model, view, controller

#### Ryan:
* Model: develop the correct physics for jumping
* Model: configure a file to hold the changeable jumping characteristics
* Model: work on developing the Entity hierarchy (split with Mike)
    * Model: build Entity collision
* Model: configure goal state

#### Mike:
* Model: load a level of a platform game
* Model: design the file that contains the platform game's data
* Model: work on developing the Entity hierarchy (split with Ryan)
    * Model: build Entity collision

#### Edem and Alex:
* View: Make splash screen
* View: build link between Controller and View
* View: build link between Controller and View
* View: build css flexibility
* View: build language flexibility 
* Controller: move player around screen and jump with spacebar
* Controller: pause game with P



## Week 2: Basic
### Goals
- Add additional levels
- Apply different textures to features of the game
- Add functional Power ups.
- Make different types of Blocks: Breakable, Unbreakable, Powerup, Damage
- Make the game scrollable: autoscroll, follow the player scroll type
- Make enemies/oppositions

#### Ryan:
* Model: Advanced level implementation
* Model: Finish power-up implementation if not already completed in Test
* Model: More goal types (point-based, time-based)
* Model: More block types (damage block, breakable block, power-up block)
* Model: Implement enemies

#### Mike:
* Model: Advanced level implementation
* Model: Finish power-up implementation if not already completed in Test
* Model: Advanced block implementation
* Model: Implement enemies

#### Edem and Alex:
* View: Display Power ups
* View: Display Enemies
* View: apply textures to different features of the game
* Model & View: make the game scrollable
* Model & View: make the game scrollable
	


## Week 3: Complete
### Goals
- Be able to play at least three types of platformer games: Mario, Flappy Bird, Doodle Jump
- Switch between different versions of the game
- Display caught exceptions
- Making better Power ups
- Keep track of scores and high scores

#### Ryan:
* Model: Advance power-up implementation
* Model: Implement different game types
* Model: Implement scorekeeping/scoretracking
* Model: Custom exceptions
* Model: Teleportation block

#### Mike:
* Model: Advance power-up implementation
* Model: Implement different game types
* Model: Implement scorekeeping/scoretracking

#### Edem and Alex:
* View: Display Scores and High Scores
* View: display caught exceptions
* Controller: switch between different versions of the game
* Controller: cheat keys
